How to make simulation of this tools monitoring program code.
1. Create the database => run Create_database_Tools.py program code
2. Check the database structure (run Check_database_structure.py) and crosscheck with the table list both in index.html and databasemocking.py
3. If everything okay, run the simulation code to simulate the database management system keep and record the data.
4. Run the local host address => http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. If you want to simulate returning the tools run this => http://127.0.0.1:5000/return/(session id)
6. If you want to generate/simulate borrowing the tools, run this => http://127.0.0.1:5000/borrow/123456/aku/Hammer123,Wrench456
